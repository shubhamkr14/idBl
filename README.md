# Basic React Three Fiber Examples

This repository contains a collection of basic React Three Fiber (R3F) examples demonstrating fundamental 3D rendering concepts. Each example focuses on a specific feature of R3F and Three.js.

## Examples

- [x] **Basic 3D Cube Renderer**: Renders a rotating cube with basic ambient and directional lighting.
- [x] **Simple 3D Scene with Shapes**: Creates a scene containing different geometric shapes (spheres, cubes, pyramids) with random colors.
- [x] **Basic OrbitControls Implementation**: Adds interactive camera controls using `@react-three/drei`'s `OrbitControls`, allowing users to orbit, zoom, and pan the scene.
- [x] **Basic Material and Texture Application**: Demonstrates how to apply a texture to a 3D object. Requires a `texture.jpg` file in the `public` folder.
- [x] **Basic Scene with Lights**: Shows how to incorporate different types of lights (ambient, directional, point) into a 3D scene.
- [x] **Basic Click-to-Change Color Interaction**: Implements an interaction where clicking on a 3D object changes its color randomly.
- [x] **Basic 3D Text Rendering**: Utilizes `@react-three/drei`'s `Text` component to display 3D text in the scene.
- [x] **Basic Shadows Implementation**: Sets up basic shadow casting and receiving for objects in the scene.
- [x] **Basic Animation with useFrame Hook**: Animates a 3D object (a bouncing sphere) using the `useFrame` hook for per-frame updates.
- [x] **Simple 3D Model Loader**: Demonstrates how to load a `.glb` or `.gltf` 3D model into the scene using `useGLTF` from `@react-three/drei`. **Requires a 3D model file in the `public` folder.**

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn add
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start the application, and you can usually view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address). Each example is likely set up as a separate component or page within the application.

## Dependencies

-   `@react-three/fiber`: The core React Three Fiber library.
-   `@react-three/drei`: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for R3F.
-   `three`: The underlying Three.js library.
-   `three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader` (for model loading).
-   `react` and `react-dom`.
-   `typescript` and `@types` for React and Three.js (if the project uses TypeScript).

## How to Explore

Each example is implemented as a separate React component. You can navigate to the specific component file (likely in a `components` or `pages` directory) to see the code for each feature.

Make sure to:

-   Place a `texture.jpg` file in the `public` folder to see the texture example.
-   Place a `.glb` or `.gltf` model file in the `public` folder and update the path in the `Simple3DModelLoader` component to test model loading.
