- [x] **Basic 3D Cube Renderer**: Renders a rotating cube with basic ambient and directional lighting.
- [x] **Simple 3D Scene with Shapes**: Creates a scene containing different geometric shapes (spheres, cubes, pyramids) with random colors.
- [x] **Basic OrbitControls Implementation**: Adds interactive camera controls using `@react-three/drei`'s `OrbitControls`, allowing users to orbit, zoom, and pan the scene.
- [x] **Basic Material and Texture Application**: Demonstrates how to apply a texture to a 3D object. Requires a `texture.jpg` file in the `public` folder.
- [x] **Basic Scene with Lights**: Shows how to incorporate different types of lights (ambient, directional, point) into a 3D scene.
- [x] **Basic Click-to-Change Color Interaction**: Implements an interaction where clicking on a 3D object changes its color randomly.
- [x] **Basic 3D Text Rendering**: Utilizes `@react-three/drei`'s `Text` component to display 3D text in the scene.
- [x] **Basic Shadows Implementation**: Sets up basic shadow casting and receiving for objects in the scene.
- [x] **Basic Animation with useFrame Hook**: Animates a 3D object (a bouncing sphere) using the `useFrame` hook for per-frame updates.
- [x] **Simple 3D Model Loader**: Demonstrates how to load a `.glb` or `.gltf` 3D model into the scene using `useGLTF` from `@react-three/drei`. **Requires a 3D model file in the `public` folder.**
